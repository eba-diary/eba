                <p>After a hurried and tiring week spent in New York at that perfect hotel, the St. Dennis, we sailed on Saturday the 16, for Egypt via Naples on that ship well known to us, the "Berlin", on which we have crossed for two years.  Only, this time I was not upstairs in the Captain’s room as usual.  We have <persName ref="Newberry_Mary">Mary Newberry</persName> and her daughter, <persName ref="Newberry_Doris">Doris</persName>, with us, making their first acquaintance with these southern waters.  But we are unfortunate - for our second day out was bad - the wind and sea increasing in violence, and for 24 hours it was terrific - it is now better, but the rain and mist continue, and we have only caught a glimpse of the Azores - which we are now passing.</p>

                <p>We dropped our anchor about 2 o’clock at Gibraltar.  Most of the passengers went ashore, <persName ref="Jones">Jones</persName> guiding <persName ref="Newberry_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="Newberry_Doris">Doris</persName>.  They were duly impressed and charmed.  We were soon off - it growing wilder as we got well into the Mediterranean.</p>

The pleasant old appartment at the Grand Hotel - a tea at Bertolini’s - and off in the Prinz Heinrick for Egypt on Friday - a very smooth passage over a summer sea, and Egypt at last, and once again.

                <p>We are now established on our boat - waiting for our tug - which should arrive in the morning.  How pleasant it is! after a whole month from home spent in hotels and steamers!  It has been a busy week in Cairo - <persName ref="Newberry_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="Newberry_Doris">Doris</persName> have been sightseeing and motoring about.  I have been once to the Museum making a visit to <persName>Sir Gaston Maspero </persName>with <persName ref="Davis_Theodore">Theo</persName>.  We spoke of the magnificent cover to the so-called <persName ref="Tyii">Tyii</persName>’s coffin which has never been shown to the public and is kept entirely apart in a private room.  A man capable of repairing it has been found, and has agreed to do the whole thing and to finish it within 5 months.  The gold work, as well as the exquisite <emph>inlay</emph> - it will be a grand addition to <persName ref="Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName>’s exhibit at the Museum.  We had quite a little tea party on Sunday afternoon, on the boat.  <persName ref="Sayce_Archibald">Mr. Sayce</persName>, <persName ref="Pasha_Artin">Artin Pasha</persName>, <persName ref="Bey_Claudius">Claudius Bey</persName> and <persName>the young Leavitts</persName>.  <persName ref="Sayce_Archibald">Mr. Sayce</persName> is on his way to India.  We gave a morning to the zoo - and generally a lot of sight seeing.</p>

                <p>We arrived about noon today - after a pleasant and successful voyage of 10 days - one day of showers - clearing with most beautiful rainbow.  We have several fine new sailors - young men - making a fine crew - of course our tug was a good strong one, making a fast voyage.  We find several friends here - <persName ref="Whymper_Charles">Mr. Whymper</persName>, <persName>Contessa di Villamarina</persName>, <persName>Mr. and Mrs. Pier</persName>, and their 2 heavenly little girls - <persName>Miss Buchanan</persName> fortunately for 2 days.

They were so pleased with our boat.  They are going to join their yacht again at Mombasa for the return home.</p>

The wind horridly bad.  <persName ref="Newberry_Mary">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="Newberry_Doris">Doris</persName> went to Barrage - the next day we moved down opposite <persName ref="Grenfell_Bernard">Grenfell</persName>’s tomb, and the girls visited them.

The new bridge is finished, and trains are running over it.  A very fine and long one - and a great convenience - but it spoils the garden somewhat.  Cairo is fast changing and improving but losing its unique interesting eastern features.  <persName>Mrs. Graham</persName> called with <persName>Major Watson</persName> and asked us to tea on Friday and very pleasant it was, as always.  <persName ref="Tremaine_Mr">Mr. Tremaine</persName> and <persName ref="Carter_Howard">Mr. Carter</persName> called.</p>

Theo has been almost every day motoring, with <persName ref="Costantini_David">David Costantini</persName> and <persName ref="Burton_Harry">Harry Burton</persName>, and some one or two of the girls.  The season is very backward - the roses just beginning to show.  Have made some pleasant visits - <persName ref="Davis_Theodore">Theo</persName> has made excursions to Faenza, Settignano - Volterra and enjoyed it keenly.  He has loved going to the Villino and hearing <persName>Nettie</persName> sing - and to drive to the Cascine for a walk along the little river, with its lovely entourage of blue mountains and green meadows and magnificent trees.  Above all I have enjoyed the companion-<pb n="113"/>ship of the two dear nieces, <persName>Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="Newberry_Mary">Mary</persName>.  We go tomorrow at 5 P.M. via the Mt.
