Nov. 21. 1912.

After a hurried and tiring week spent in New York at that perfect hotel, the St. Dennis, we sailed on Saturday the 16, for Egypt via Naples on that ship well known to us, the “Berlin”, on which we have crossed for two years.  Only, this time I was not upstairs in the Captain’s room as usual.  We have Mary Newberry and her daughter, Doris, with us, making their first acquaintance with these southern waters.  But we are unfortunate - for our second day out was bad - the wind and sea increasing in violence, and for 24 hours it was terrific - it is now better, but the rain and mist continue, and we have only caught a glimpse of the Azores - which we are now passing.

Sunday. Nov. 24th.

We dropped our anchor about 2 o’clock at Gibraltar.  Most of the passengers went ashore, Jones guiding Mary and Doris.  They were duly impressed and charmed.  We were soon off - it growing wilder as we got well into the Mediterranean.

Tuesday. Nov. 26th.

Reached Algiers after dark - many went ashore - mild and lovely.

Wednesday. Oct. 27th. (Sarah’s note - it should be Nov. 27th. Either EBA or typist’s mistake)

Arrived at noon today - found Harry waiting for us.  The pleasant old appartment at the Grand Hotel - a tea at Bertolini’s - and off in the Prinz Heinrick for Egypt on Friday - a very smooth passage over a summer sea, and Egypt at last, and once again.  How glad we were for Theodore’s sake - and he was so happy to find himself once more here!

Dahabya Beduin. Dec. 11th.

We are now established on our boat - waiting for our tug - which should arrive in the morning.  How pleasant it is! after a whole month from home spent in hotels and steamers! It has been a busy week in Cairo - Mary and Doris have been sightseeing and motoring about.  I have been once to the Museum making a visit to Sir Gaston Maspero with Theo.  We spoke of the magnificent cover to the so-called Tyii’s coffin which has never been shown to the public and is kept entirely apart in a private room.  A man capable of repairing it has been found, and has agreed to do the whole thing and to finish it within 5 months.  The gold work, as well as the exquisite inlay - it will be a grand addition to Theodore’s exhibit at the Museum.  We had quite a little tea party on Sunday afternoon, on the boat.  Mr. Sayce, Artin Pasha, Claudius Bey and the young Leavitts.  Mr. Sayce is on his way to India.  We gave a morning to the zoo - and generally a lot of sight seeing.

Saturday. Dec. 21

We arrived about noon today - after a pleasant and successful voyage of 10 days - one day of showers - clearing with most beautiful rainbow.  We have several fine new sailors - young men - making a fine crew - of course our tug was a good strong one, making a fast voyage.  We find several friends here - Mr. Whymper, Contessa di Villamarina, Mr. and Mrs. Pier, and their 2 heavenly little girls - Miss Buchanan fortunately for 2 days.  She is now at the head of the American College for girls in Cairo.  On the 24th the Serapis arrived with Mr. and Mrs. Tuck of Paris, Major Curley of Newport, Miss Nelson and Miss Morgan, niece of Mr. Tuck.  They and Mr. Nicol were here to tea on Christmas day, and Harry Burton and Mr. Crane to lunch.

Friday. Dec. 27th.

We all - four of us, and Jones went over to the Valley, and stayed 3 days - and had a jolly visit.  Mr. and Mrs. Arthur James of Newport, who sailed from there on their yacht, the “Aloha” just before we left, arrived on the “Hyksos” came to tea.  They were so pleased with our boat.  They are going to join their yacht again at Mombasa for the return home.

Saturday. Jan. 3rd.

Mary, Doris and I crossed over and paid a visit to Mr. Nicol.  He has the very best picture I ever saw of his - the wonderful mountain range opposite Luxor - the finest view in all Egypt I think.  He says he painted it for me - but Mr. and Mrs. Pier who were her to lunch, say that they are to have it.

It has been warm and charming most of the week.  We have had the Contessa and Mr. Tremaine, Mr. Alan Gardner (Sarah:sic), Mr. and Mrs. Longyear and son on their homeward bound voyage from India, Mr. Fahnstock to tea, Mr. Tremaine to lunch, and Mr. Whymper to breakfast this week, to say nothing of a charming little white baby donkey, which one of the sailors brought on the lower deck, to amuse the Pier children.  We have had some warm days.

Very warm.  Mr. Whymper to breakfast - the Piers to lunch.  Mrs. Aylener and Morehouse to tea.  We have had Mr. and Mrs. Hardy to tea - Senator Aldrich also.  Mary N. and I have been over to the Winter Palace for tea - we looked very smart on Washington’s birthday with all our flags.

Sunday. March 2nd.

On Monday Mary and I went to tea with the Contessa in the gardens of the Luxor Hotel - met Lady Baring, Miss Murray, and Contessa Pappenheim and daughter. Charming people all - yesterday we left for Aswân.

Sunday. March 9th.

This is our record for the week - very high wind from the time we left Luxor.  Stopped at Edfou - Kom Ombo - where we were held some time by furious wind - after leaving we passed the most wonderful mass of flamingoes - absolutely dense masses of them - attending a mile or two - very remarkable - reached Aswan the 4th.  The wind horridly bad. Mary and Doris went to Barrage - the next day we moved down opposite Grenfell’s tomb, and the girls visited them.  The 7th we left Aswan, the terrific wind still holding - so that we were tied up some time

PAGE 111

below Kom Ombo - the next day we struck upon 3 sand banks, or rather our tug did - and reached here this morning.

Sunday. Mar. 16th.

We spent the days Monday and Tuesday in Luxor - Doris and I went over to the town - and Mrs. Crispell and her niece came from the Mayflower to tea - I was so pleased with her.  Mr. Crane and Harry came to tea, and we left Luxor the 12th at noon - having had a nice visit from Old Hagg Mahassib - Nag Hamadi the 13 - Balliana the 14 - where we stopped for Mary, Doris, Amelie, Jones and Hassein to visit Abydos - very cold and terrific wind - very severe in the night and rough today.  We passed the Arabia stuck at 8:30 A.M. Cold, constant wind.

Wednesday. April 2nd.

We left the boat very reluctantly several days ago, that charming little home, and came to the Ghizereh Palace Hotel - and into our old rooms.  Hotel almost empty.  The new bridge is finished, and trains are running over it.  A very fine and long one - and a great convenience - but it spoils the garden somewhat. Cairo is fast changing and improving but losing its unique interesting eastern features.  Mrs. Graham called with Major Watson and asked us to tea on Friday and very pleasant it was, as always.  Mr. Tremaine and Mr. Carter called.

Home all day - Baron v. Bissing called and stopped for tea.  Contessa Villamarina and Mlle. Johannis too.

Elena Rathbone and her friend Miss Cholanley just back from India came to tea, as well as Mr. Anthony and Mr. Lythgoe.

Saturday. April 12th.

Arrived in Naples at 7:30 this morning, landed in the hideous confusion characteristic of the N.G.L. steamers - rain and cold winds.

Wednesday. April 16th.

Came to Florence - a long days journey - very cold.  Vesuvius and the mountains all this way up, covered with snow. We came to the Grande Bretagne and to our old appartment  - we have had a little fire every day.  Theo has been almost every day motoring, with David Costantini and Harry Burton, and some one or two of the girls.  The season is very backward - the roses just beginning to show.  Have made some pleasant visits - Theo has made excursions to Faenza, Settignano - Volterra and enjoyed it keenly.  He has loved going to the Villino and hearing Nettie sing - and to drive to the Cascine for a walk along the little river, with its lovely entourage of blue mountains and green meadows and magnificent trees.  Above all I have enjoyed the companion-

ship of the two dear nieces, Nettie and Mary.  We go tomorrow at 5 P.M. via the Mt. Cenie pass to London.
